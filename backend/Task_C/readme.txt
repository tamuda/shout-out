File Descriptions
1. create.sql: This script is meticulously designed to establish the foundational structure of the `foodpantryuofr` database. It meticulously delineates the schema for a series of tables, namely Users, Events, Feedback, Awards, and Shout-outs each playing a pivotal role in the database's architecture. 

2. load.sql: Complementing the structure established by `create.sql`, this script is tasked with the initial population of the database. It injects a series of pre-defined data entries into each table.

Important Considerations
- The `load.sql` script presupposes the existence of the database and tables as established by `create.sql`.
